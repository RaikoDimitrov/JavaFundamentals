 Java Fundamentals Project
Practice with multiple exercises covering core java fundamentals.
Overview
The Java Fundamentals project within the com.company package provides a collection of exercises, examples, and code snippets for mastering core Java programming concepts. This project is organized into modules that cover foundational Java topics such as basic syntax, collections, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It's intended for those looking to strengthen their understanding of Java basics and develop practical skills.

Each module in this project is self-contained and focuses on a specific Java concept, enabling developers to learn and practice at their own pace.

Project Structure
The com.company package is organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
src/com/company
├── Main.java            # Main entry point for launching various examples
├── arrays               # Array-related exercises and examples
├── lists                # Working with List collections and examples
├── maps                 # Examples demonstrating Map collection usage
├── sets                 # Working with Set collections and examples
├── oop                  # Object-oriented programming examples
├── streams              # Using Java Streams for functional-style operations
└── algorithms           # Common algorithms and sorting/searching techniques
Each subpackage includes Java classes and methods that explore specific concepts, with individual classes representing focused exercises or examples.

Modules and Key Concepts
1. Main.java
Entry point of the project, providing a way to navigate through different examples and modules.
Often acts as a demo file for testing or running specific methods in the project.
2. Arrays
Focuses on operations with arrays, including iteration, searching, sorting, and multidimensional arrays.
Key classes and methods cover:
Basic array manipulations
Sorting and searching algorithms for arrays
3. Lists
Introduces the List interface and its implementations (ArrayList, LinkedList).
Covers list operations like adding, removing, sorting, and filtering.
Examples demonstrate differences between list types and explore list manipulation techniques.
4. Maps
Covers the Map interface and popular implementations such as HashMap and TreeMap.
Demonstrates how to store and retrieve key-value pairs, iterate through entries, and utilize map operations like merging and filtering.
5. Sets
Focuses on the Set interface and implementations like HashSet and TreeSet.
Includes operations for union, intersection, and set difference, as well as an exploration of set properties (e.g., uniqueness).
6. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Explores core OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Contains examples of classes, interfaces, inheritance hierarchies, and abstract classes.
Key concepts demonstrated:
Class and object creation
Inheritance and interface implementation
Polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch
7. Streams
Introduces the Java Stream API, which enables functional-style operations on collections.
Demonstrates use cases for filtering, mapping, reducing, and collecting data from streams.
Examples focus on working with collections in a declarative way using lambda expressions.
8. Algorithms
Implements basic algorithms such as sorting (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) and searching techniques (e.g., linear and binary search).
Serves as an introduction to algorithmic thinking and problem-solving using Java.
